# Xbox Discord RPC
Lightweight Discord RPC for your Xbox games, works with xbox one and xbox 360, made in Python.

### What this is
This shows all your friends what game you are currently playing, and for how long you have been playing it. As of right now that is all it does, however if you have any suggestion feel free to make a pull request, or DM me on Discord if you would rather me implement it. 

### What this is not
This is a extremely early version of this project, so there may be a few bugs, as of right now I know that it works with Xbox 360, and it should work with Xbox One. If you encounter any bugs please submit and issue, and I will work to resolve it ASAP
